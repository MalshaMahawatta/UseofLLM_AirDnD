If there is a pedestrian, they are not easily discernible in this image due to the lighting and distance.
1507730166808010_front, using GPT4V (took 9.36 seconds): Yes, there is a pedestrian in this image. The pedestrian is located on the left side of the image, crossing the street in the crosswalk. They are approximately in the middle of the crosswalk, moving from the left side of the street towards the right, and are just past the median. The pedestrian appears to be walking in a direction that is perpendicular to the viewpoint of the camera.
1507730166808010_front, using GPT4o (took 4.69 seconds): The image does not show a pedestrian. The scene shows multiple vehicles on the road, a traffic light, and buildings on either side of the street, but no visible pedestrian in the frame.
1507730166808010_front, using GPT4o (took 6.73 seconds): In the provided image, there does not appear to be a pedestrian visible. The image primarily shows a street, some vehicles, a building, traffic lights, and distant palm trees under a sunset sky. There is no discernible pedestrian in the frame.
1507774060088103_front, using GPT4V (took 6.97 seconds): I'm sorry, but I cannot make out any clear figures or shapes that would resemble a pedestrian in the image provided. The image is dark and the quality of the photograph does not reveal enough detail to confirm the presence of a person. If there is a pedestrian, they are not visible due to the lighting conditions and resolution of the photo.
1507774060088103_front, using GPT4V (took 7.13 seconds): I'm sorry, but the image is quite dark and it's challenging to discern specific details. I cannot confirm the presence of a pedestrian in this image with certainty. If you believe there's a pedestrian, could you please provide more information or point out where in the image you think they are located?

1507774060088103_front, using GPT4o (took 6.82 seconds): No, there doesn't appear to be a pedestrian in this image. The scene is quite dark, showing a road with a car in the distance and street lights, but no visible pedestrians.
1508199140017233_front, using GPT4V (took 6.02 seconds): Yes, I can see a pedestrian in the image. The pedestrian is located in the center of the picture, walking across the crosswalk on the road. The pedestrian appears to be in the middle of the crosswalk, moving from the camera's left to right, and is wearing bright clothing, likely for visibility. The traffic lights for the direction the pedestrian is crossing are red, so the pedestrian seems to be crossing legally.
1508199140017233_front, using GPT4V (took 6.4 seconds): Yes, there appears to be a pedestrian in the image. The person is located roughly in the center of the picture, crossing the street in a crosswalk. It appears that the pedestrian is walking from the left side of the street to the right side in relation to the perspective of the photo. The sun is low on the horizon, which creates a glare that obscures some of the details, but the silhouette is clearly that of a person walking.
1508199140017233_front, using GPT4o (took 4.59 seconds): Yes, there is a pedestrian in the image. The pedestrian is located in the center of the crosswalk, crossing the street. The person is slightly to the right of the centerline of the image, in front of a group of vehicles waiting at the red light. The pedestrian appears to be wearing an orange top.
1508199140017233_front, using GPT4o (took 5.54 seconds): Yes, there is a pedestrian in the image. The pedestrian is positioned on the crosswalk near the center of the image, slightly to the right, crossing the street. The pedestrian is wearing what appears to be an orange top.
1511379238161677_front, using GPT4V (took 7.85 seconds): Yes, there is a pedestrian in the center of the image, walking across a crosswalk. The individual is wearing a lime green safety vest and carrying a red stop sign, suggesting they may be a crossing guard assisting children crossing the street. The pedestrian is facing the left side of the image and appears to be in the middle of the road, with vehicles stopped or parked on either side.
1511379238161677_front, using GPT4V (took 7.99 seconds): Yes, there is a pedestrian in the image. The pedestrian is positioned approximately in the center of the photo, standing in a crosswalk on the road. The individual is wearing a high-visibility vest and is holding a red "STOP" sign, which indicates they may be a crossing guard facilitating a safe passage for children across the street.
1511379238161677_front, using GPT4V (took 8.65 seconds): Yes, there is a pedestrian in this image. The individual is located in the center of the image, standing in the middle of a crosswalk on a road. The pedestrian is wearing a high-visibility safety vest and is holding a red "STOP" sign, indicating the role of a crossing guard assisting school children across the crosswalk. The position of the pedestrian is directly between the two lanes of the road, with vehicles on either side indicating that the traffic has stopped to allow the crossing.
1511379238161677_front, using GPT4o (took 5.34 seconds): Yes, there is a pedestrian in the image. The pedestrian is in the middle of a crosswalk, facing to the right, and holding a "STOP" sign. The person is wearing a yellow safety vest.
